  - title: "Purpose"
    image: "/images/service-3.png"
    content: "The primary purpose of file converters is to bridge the gap between different software, platforms, and devices. They ensure that data remains accessible, usable, and efficient, regardless of where or how it's being used."
    bulletpoints:
      - "Compatibility: Not all software applications can read or edit all file formats. A file converter allows a file to be changed into a format that is compatible with a different application or platform."
      - "File Size Optimization: Some file converters can compress files during the conversion process, resulting in smaller file sizes."
      - "Data Migration: When transitioning from one software system to another, it may be necessary to convert data files to the new system's preferred format."
      - "Accessibility: Converting files to universal or widely accepted formats can make it easier to share and access them on various devices and platforms."
